This project involves processing EEG data to classify different types of motion using machine learning.
It includes loading and preprocessing the EEG data,
extracting relevant features, and implementing a classification pipeline
with dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA or CSP.
The goal is to train the model and then predict motion types
from a continuous stream of EEG data within a 2-second delay.
